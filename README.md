# todolist

Created a user-specific TodoList website where we can track our important work and set reminder to complete the task.

Simple design was integrated using HTML, CSS. The backend of this website was created on Nodejs, Express. 
Also, we added a database to store all the data that user inputs here. It was achieved through MongoDB Atlas.  Finally deployed it using Heroku.

The complete site can be accessed here - https://salty-ocean-82480.herokuapp.com/
